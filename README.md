# README #

The expiration date plugin adds the option to make a PDC item expire after certain date. Expired items will not be shown on the default PDC items endpoint. 

Expired items can be retrieved from the endpoint `owc/pwc/v1/items/expired`.

### How do I get set up? ###
     
* Unzip and/or move all files to the /wp-content/plugins/pdc-expiration-date directory
* Log into WordPress admin and activate the ‘PDC Internal’ plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu

### Filters & Actions

There are various [hooks](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Hooks), which allows for changing the output.

##### Action for changing main Plugin object.
```php
'owc/pdc-expiration-date/plugin'
```

### Translations ###

If you want to use your own set of labels/names/descriptions and so on you can do so. 
All text output in this plugin is controlled via the gettext methods.

Please use your preferred way to make your own translations from the /wp-content/plugins/pdc-base/languages/pdc-base.pot file

Be careful not to put the translation files in a location which can be overwritten by a subsequent update of the plugin, theme or WordPress core.

We recommend using the 'Loco Translate' plugin. 
https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/

This plugin provides an easy interface for custom translations and a way to store these files without them getting overwritten by updates.

For instructions how to use the 'Loco Translate' plugin, we advice you to read the Beginners's guide page on their website: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin/beginners
or start at the homepage: https://localise.biz/wordpress/plugin
